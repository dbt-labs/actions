# **what?**
# For issues that have been open for awhile without activity, label
# them as stale with a warning that they will be closed out. If
# anyone comments to keep the issue open, it will automatically
# remove the stale label and keep it open.

# Stale label rules:
# awaiting_response, more_information_needed -> 90 days
# good_first_issue, help_wanted -> 360 days (a year)
# tech_debt -> 720 (2 years)
# all else defaults -> 180 days (6 months)

# **why?**
# To keep the repo in a clean state from issues that aren't relevant anymore

# **when?**
# Triggered by the repos but usually on a schedule to run once a day
