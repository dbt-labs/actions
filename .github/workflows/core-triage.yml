# **what?**
# Automates adding issues and PRs from Core repositories
# to the "Core triage" project in GitHub.
#
# Inputs:
#   GH_TOKEN: GitHub authorization token with sufficient scope
#      - needed (I think): org:read, org:write, project:read, project:write

# **why?**
# Unfortunately, GitHub projects don't support this easily.
# We could add a workflow in each new project, or just run
# this on a schedule.

# **when?**
# Every ~hour, on PR, or manually.
