# **what?**
# This workflow installs the latest version of dbt adapter from sources.
# It then runs 'dbt --version' to verify the installation was successful.
# If it fails for the scheduled runs, it will post to our team alerts channel.

# **why?**
# This is a simple way to test all adapter installations at a single
# time. It allows us to test them on a schedule as well to check for
# any breaking dependency changes that might happen and alert us on it.

# **when?**
# This reusable workflow can be called or started manually
# by specifying the package name
